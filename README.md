# Habitat Workstation

Cookbooks and Packer config to create a workstation for use during Habitat workshops.

## Current Amazon Machine Image IDs

AMIs are currently only available in `us-east` region. Make sure you have a keypair setup in that region.
*NOTE*: Ensure your `~/.aws/config` region is set to `us-east-1` pending region abstraction.

An `~/.aws/config` file might look like:

```
[default]
region=us-east-1
aws_access_key_id = MYKEYID
aws_secret_access_key = MYACCESSKEY
```

## Pre-requisites

```
# The name of the AWS KeyPair to use for deployment
export $AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME='your_aws_keypair_name'
```

## Build the Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)

This rake task updates the vendored cookbooks before building the AMIs.

`$ rake cookbook:vendor`

### To create AMIs with Habitat installed

`$ rake "ami:build[ubuntu-1604,0.24.1]"`

The latest version of Habitat will be installed,
The version is for display purposes unless set to `none`

### To create AMIs without Habitat installed

`$ rake "ami:build[centos-7,none]"`

### List available templates

```
$ rake list:templates
centos-7
rhel-7
ubuntu-1404
ubuntu-1604
```

## Share the AMIs with other Amazon accounts

```bash
$ export AMI_ID=the_ami_id_generated_by_packer
$ rake ami:share
```

## Deploy the CloudFormation stack

This deploys a CloudFormation stack with the number of hosts and TTL (days).
A template will be created in `stacks/` with the arguments above using values from
`config.yml`.  An example, `config.example.yml`, is included

```bash
# rake deploy[name,num_hosts,ttl]

$ export AMI_ID=the AMI_ID #(generated by the rake task "ami:build above)
$ rake "deploy[habihacks-stack,10,3]"
```

```
$ cat config.example.yml
